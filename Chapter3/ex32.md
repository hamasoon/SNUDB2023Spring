So the question paraphrased is as follows: write an SQL query to find the ID and name 
of each instructor who has never given an A grade in any course she or 
he has taught and who has given at least one other non-null grade in some course.


```sql
SELECT ID, name 
FROM instructor AS i
WHERE 'A' NOT IN (
        SELECT takes.grade
        FROM takes JOIN teaches USING (course_id, sec_id, semester, year)
        WHERE teaches.ID = i.ID
) AND
'A+' NOT IN (
        SELECT takes.grade
        FROM takes JOIN teaches USING (course_id, sec_id, semester, year)
        WHERE teaches.ID = i.ID
) AND
'A-' NOT IN (
    SELECT takes.grade
    FROM takes JOIN teaches USING (course_id, sec_id, semester, year)
    WHERE teaches.ID = i.ID
) AND
i.ID IN (
    SELECT teaches.ID
    FROM takes JOIN teaches USING (course_id, sec_id, semester, year)
    WHERE takes.grade NOT NULL
)
```

```sql
SELECT id, name 
FROM instructor AS i
WHERE 'A' NOT IN (
    SELECT takes.grade
    FROM takes INNER JOIN teaches 
        ON (takes.course_id,takes.sec_id,takes.semester,takes.year) = 
           (teaches.course_id,teaches.sec_id,teaches.semester,teaches.year)
    WHERE teaches.id = i.id
) 
AND
(
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM takes INNER JOIN teaches 
        ON (takes.course_id,takes.sec_id,takes.semester,takes.year) = 
           (teaches.course_id,teaches.sec_id,teaches.semester,teaches.year)
    WHERE teaches.id = i.id AND takes.grade IS NOT NULL    
) >= 1
