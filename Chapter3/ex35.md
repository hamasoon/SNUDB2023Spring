--------------------------------

```sql
SELECT course_id, sec_id, year, semester, COUNT(DISTINCT ID) AS num
FROM section NATURAL JOIN takes
GROUP BY course_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT ID) >= (
    SELECT MAX(num)
  	FROM (
		SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ID) AS num
		FROM section NATURAL JOIN takes
		GROUP BY course_id
	)
)
```
